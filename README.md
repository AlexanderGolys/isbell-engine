# Implemented features:
- basic hyperbolic geometry
- shading with Phong material model, both vertex and face based triangular meshes
- Kleinian groups and hyperbolic tesselations
- curvatures, torsion, fundamental forms, mean curvature flow
- deformations of 1-parameter families
- 2D rigid bodies
- 2D diffusion schemes
- discrete exterior calculus
- Bezier and spline interpolations, Coons patches
- Function algebras, vector fields, differential forms
- custom curve rendering not causing deformations

In progress:
- Eulerian incompressible fluids
- rigid body physics in 3D
- hyperbolic geometry in 3D
- different non-Euclidean metrics\
- connections
